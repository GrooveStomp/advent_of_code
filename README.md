# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels.

This repo contains my solutions to various advent of code challenges.

The organization of this repo is by date, then by languages, for example:


    └── advent_of_code
        └── 2019
            └── 01
                ├── c
                ├── go
                ├── odin
                ├── rust
                └── zig

Unless otherwise specified, all programs are written with no option switches and no usage text.  If input is required, it is expected to be in a file in the immediate parent directory named `input.txt`, and any output is written directly to stdout without any kind of formatting or context.
